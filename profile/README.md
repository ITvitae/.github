## About ITvitae

ITvitae offers ICT training, including coaching and job placement, especially for young people with a neurodivergent brain (such as autism, giftedness or ADHD) and anyone who benefits from our unique teaching methods and guidance. Our goal is to guide you to a sustainable job as an ICT professional. (Machine translation from web page linked below)
